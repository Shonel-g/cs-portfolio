## SQL Injection (SQLi) Automation Modules

This directory contains custom Python scripts developed to detect and exploit SQL Injection vulnerabilities, based on the **PortSwigger Web Security Academy** labs (OWASP Top 10).

### Purpose
The goal of these scripts is to move beyond "point-and-click" tools and demonstrate a deep understanding of:
- **The HTTP Protocol:** Manually crafting GET/POST requests and analyzing server responses.
- **SQL Logic:** Constructing specific payloads to manipulate backend database queries.
- **Vulnerability Mechanics:** Understanding how application logic breaks under specific input conditions.

### Why Python?
While tools like Burp Suite are industry standards, I developed these custom scripts to:
1.  **Demonstrate Automation:** Show the ability to script repetitive attack vectors programmatically.
2.  **Optimize Resources:** Create lightweight, command-line solutions that run efficiently on any hardware.
3.  **Showcase Engineering Mindset:** Prove the ability to build custom tooling when standard solutions are not applicable or require customization.

*Note: All scripts are Proof of Concepts (PoCs) intended for educational environments and authorized testing only.*
