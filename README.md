## 🛡️ About This Repository
This repository serves as a centralized collection of my practical cybersecurity projects and research. 

Coming from an **Engineering background**, my approach to cybersecurity is not just about using tools, but **understanding how they work internally**. Instead of relying solely on commercial automated scanners, I build custom tools from scratch (using Python/Bash) to deeply understand the underlying protocols (HTTP, TCP/IP) and vulnerability mechanics.

Each project in this portfolio addresses a specific domain of the **Cyber Kill Chain** or **OWASP Top 10**.
